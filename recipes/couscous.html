            <strong>Couscous</strong> is originally an <em>Amazigh</em> (aka Berber) dish and for this reason couscous <br>
            is a staple dish in many North African countries. In Morocco, we have different <br>
            types and versions of couscous but if you mention “couscous” in Morocco, people <br>
            will usually assume that you are referring to the most basic version of the famous <br>
            dish: the 7 vegetables couscous. <br><br>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2> 
        <ol>
            <p>
                <li>
                    In a large casserole (minimum 5 litres capacity), heat the olive oil over medium heat and add in the onions, meat, spices, salt, <br>
                    pepper and tomato pieces. Turn the meat occasionally until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. <br>
                   
                </li><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    Add 1.5 litres of water and the chickpeas. Bring to the boil, reduce to medium low heat and place the coriander bouquet in the casserole. <br>
                    Cover with a lid and let gently simmer for 50 minutes. Meanwhile,prepare the vegetables and set them aside until ready to use. <br>
                  
                </li><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    Carefully discard the coriander bouquet and place the cabbage, turnip and carrots in the broth, cover the casserole with a lid and leave to <br>
                    simmer for 35 minutes. Make sure the vegetables don't stay at the surface and are inserted in the broth, otherwise they might not cook evenly. <br>
 
                </li><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    Add the potatoes to the broth and cover the casserole with a lid for another 20 minutes.  <br>
                </li><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, place some of the broth (about 6 tablespoons) in a separate casserole or large deep skillet over medium heat and  <br>
                    add in the courgettes and butternut pieces. Cover with a lid and cook for 20 minutes until fully cooked. Flip the courgettes and <br>
                    butternut halfway through cooking. The reason why we cook the courgettes and the butternut separately is because once <br>
                    cooked, they become very fragile and they might break if you cook them in the broth with the rest of the vegetables. <br>
                </li><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    At this stage, your broth and vegetables are ready to be served. Adjust the seasoning by adding salt if necessary. <br>
                </li><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    Using tongs, carefully remove the meat from the casserole and cut the meat into smaller individual pieces. To serve, place warm <br>
                    couscous grains in a large plate and top with meat, vegetables and some tablespoons of the broth to make it moist. Add raisins (optional). <br>
                </li><br>
